# MapPinEnhanced

MapPinEnhanced is adding a lot of features to enhance the built in Blizzard MapPins.

This addon is a simple extension to the Blizzard UI to have more possibilites while using the ingame navigation system.

Â MapPinEnhanced offers the following features:

- Set as many waypoints as you want (no "one-waypoint" limit)
- Set waypoints via command (additionally to the Ctrl-LeftClick)
- A PinTracker to see a list of all the pins
- Use the importbox to import multiple waypoints at once

Additionally there are following chat commands:

- _/mph pintracker_: Toggle the pintracker
- _/mph removeall_: Remove all pins
- _/mph import_: Open the importbox
- _/mph minimap_: Toggle the minimapbutton

The slash commands work very similar to TomTom and support the following three prefixes _/way_, _/pin_ or _/mph_.
